# Contribution Requirements
Welcome to the contribution requirements! This document will outline the steps needed to submit and ultimately merge your changes into the live codebase.

## Getting Started
To start making contributions follow the steps below:

1. Discuss how you would like to contribute through an issue.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Create a branch based on the `master` branch.

Now that you're ready to contribute, below are some things to keep in mind to make sure the pull request gets approved quickly.

### Testing
When working on bug fixes or adding new features, ensure you build tests to keep the codebase healthy and maintainable.

### Formatting
Making sure formatting, naming conventions, and file structure match the rest of the project is essential to keeping a healthy codebase. Use common sense when applying this to your contributions.

*I am not too picky about how the code is formatted inside methods.*

### Documentation
If you're changing the codebase, make sure any classes, methods, etc., are well documented, so it's easy to understand what your change is doing. This project uses [summary tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/codedoc) for documenting code structures.

### New Dependencies
If you need to include a new dependency into the project, mention that in the issue about your contribution. The dependency should be compatible with the project's [current license](https://mit-license.org/).

## Before you Submit
Once you've made your changes, there are a few more steps to take before submitting a pull request.

1. Merge the up-to-date `master` into your branch.
2. Make sure all new and old tests pass.

## You're good to go!
Once you submit your pull request, it'll be under review. During the review process, you will receive feedback on what to change. When everything looks good, the request will be merged into the `master` branch.

### I hope to see new contributions from you which move the project forward in extraordinary ways.
